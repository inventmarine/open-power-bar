Comes complete, with Firmware, build instructions and a software to communicate with the Board.  \r\n\r\nIt was originally designed for use with Aquarium Controllers, like the Reefmate from Invent Marine and <a href=\"http://reefangel.com\">Reef Angel</a>, it can also be used by anyone willing to control 220/110V power sockets.\r\n\r\n![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5478/10061708973_5b43a83741_z.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Bill of materials\r\n1. 8 relays board\r\n2. 1 Enclosure: $7\r\n3. 8 extension cables: $16\r\n4. 1 Arduino nano: $5\r\n5. 1 Power cable: \r\n6. 1 power cable connector:\r\n7.

It is also illegal in some countries, like Australia and can void your home insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sponsor\r\nThis project is proudly sponsored by <a href=\"http://inventmarine.com\" targe=\"_new\">Invent Marine</a>\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n@fsamir - Franklin Dattein \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
